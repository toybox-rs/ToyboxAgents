# Tutorial

You will need to install the `toybox-extras` package to run the tutorial:

1. Initialize your virtual environment (e.g., `source .env/bin/activate`)
2. Run `python setup.py install`

If you plan to do development work after this, make sure you uninstall the dependency (i.e., run `pip uninstall toybox-extras`), or your development changes will not be reflected when you run locally.
