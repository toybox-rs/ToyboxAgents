# Autonomous Agents for Explanation using Toybox

## Getting started

ToyboxAgents depends on both the core [Toybox package](https://github.com/toybox-rs/toybox-rs) and the [intervention API](https://github.com/toybox-rs/Toybox/tree/master/toybox/interventions), found in the [Toybox testing repository](https://github.com/toybox-rs/Toybox). We recommend running with a virtual environment and installing via pip:

`pip -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`

## Generating data

Once you load up your virtual environment, you can see usage, e.g., via `python -m agents`, executed from the top-level directory. The [Tutorials](https://github.com/KDL-umass/ToyboxAgents/wiki/Tutorials) page in the wiki has detailed information on how to run things. Note that wiki pages can be downloaded for offline perusal.
